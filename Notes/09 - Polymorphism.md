Greek word that mean "**having several forms**". In this context, a "form" is a type (primitive/user defined).

The **polymorphic** elements are:
- **Functions** (operators, methods): with the same name can take as parameters many types;
- **Types** (parametric data types, type constructors, generics...): ;

## Classification of Polymorphism
There are **2 main categories** of polymorphism. Mind that they are **not mutual exclusive**: we can have both at the same time.

The full schema is the following ($\rightarrow$ means that points to an already existing node of the tree):
- **Ad hoc**:
	- **Overloading**;
	- **Overriding**;
- **Universal**:
	- **Coercion**;
	- **Inclusion**:
		- $\rightarrow$ **Overriding**;
		- $\rightarrow$ **Bounded**;
	- **Parametric**:
		- **Implicit**;
		- **Explicit**:
			- **Bounded**:
				- **Covariant**;
				- **Invariant**;
				- **Contravariant**;

## Ad Hoc Polymorphism
With **ad hoc** polymorphism the **same function name** denotes different algorithms (**different code**). The code to execute is determined by the actual types.

### Overloading
Concept present in all languages, at least built in for arithmetic operators such as `+`, `*`, â€¦
- E.g. Java: `+` is the sum for numbers but also the concatenation of strings;

A language can support it for:
- **Functions** (Java, C++);
- **Primitive operators** (C++, Haskell);

The code to **execute** is determined by the **type of the arguments**, thus:
- **Early binding** in statically typed languages;
- **Dynamic Binding** in dynamically typed languages;

#### Example
Let's say that we want to implement: $f(x) = x^2$

*C Language*
```C
// no support for overloading:  
// different names for the same logic
int intSqr(int x){
	return x * x;
}
double doubleSqr(double x){
	return x * x
}
```

*Java, C++*
```java
// overloading: the implementation to
// execute is decided based on the type of pars
int sqr(int x){
	return x * x;
}
double sqr(double x){
	return x * x
}
```

*Haskell*
[[Haskell Polymorphism#Type Classes]]

### Overriding
A method `m()` of a class `A` can be redefined in a subclass `B` of `A`

Example:
```java
A a = new B(); //legal
a.m(); // the overridden method in B is invoked
```

## Universal Polymorphism 
With **universal** polymorphism there is **only one algorithm**: a single (universal) solution that is applied to different objects. The call of the algorithm is **type independent**: it is the algorithm that can handle different types of arguments.

### Coercion
It is the **automatic conversion** of an object to a different type. It is **opposed to casting**, which is explicit.

It is usually done when the conversion cannot provoke any **loss of information** (no harm is done). Otherwise, **casting** is **required**, as the compiler can't take the liberty of destroying potentially useful info.

*Example*:
```C
int x = 5; 
double dy = 3.14;

// coercion, "implicit casting", no info loss
double dx = x; 

//casting, potentially dangerous info loss
int y = (int) dy; 
```

*Coercion can be used for polymorphism* but it is a **degenerate and uninteresting case**:
```C
double sqrt(double x){...}

// The parameter is an int, which is coerced to double
double d = sqrt(5); 
```

### Inclusion
Inclusion polymorphism is also known as **subtyping polymorphism**, or just *inheritance*.

The polymorphism is ensured by the **substitution principle**: an object of a subtype (subclass) can be used in any context where an object of the supertype (superclass) is expected. That is because the subclass has *at least* all the fields and methods of the superclass

Java and C++ uses the substitution principle for classes: **methods/functions** with formal parameter of type $T$ accept an actual parameter of type $S <: T$ ($S$ subtype of $T$).

WARNING: even if we inherit a method it doesn't mean that we are always in this case of polymorphism, as we could override it.

### Parametric
In **Parametric polymorphism** a function/type can be **generic**, **operating** on values of **different types**.

It can be:
- **Implicit**: the **type** of a polymorphic function/type is **inferred** based on its use. E.g.:
```Haskell
-- The `length` function is polymorphic, as it can operate on lists of any type.
let length xs = 
	case xs of
		[] -> 0
		x:xs' -> 1 + length xs'

-- Usage
length [1,2,3]         -- inferred type: Int
length ["foo", "bar"]  -- inferred type: Int
length ['a', 'b', 'c'] -- inferred type: Int
```
- **Explicit**: the **type** of a polymorphic function/type is **given**. E.g.:
```Java
// Class `Box` is parameterized with a type variable `T`, which can be any type.
public class Box<T> {
  private T contents;

  public void set(T contents) {
    this.contents = contents;
  }

  public T get() {
    return contents;
  }
}

// Usage
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
Box<Integer> intBox = new Box<>();
```

An example of **implicit** parametric polymorphism is [[14 - Haskell|Type Inference in Haskell]].

Instead, 2 examples of **explicit** polymorphism are:
- [[C++ Templates]];
- [[Java Generics]].
